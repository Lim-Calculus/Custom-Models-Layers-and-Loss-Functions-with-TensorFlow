# Week 1 Learning Objectives - Functional APIs
Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!
- Review Sequential API and compare with Functional API
- Describe new model types that you can build with Functional API
- Functional API: define input, layers, and model
- Use Functional API to build a model
- Use Functional API to create a model that produces multiple outputs
- Use Functional API to build a Siamese network
