## Week 1: Multiple Output Models using the Keras Functional API
Welcome to the first programming assignment of the course! Your task will be to use the Keras functional API to train a model to predict two outputs. For this lab, you will use the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. It has separate datasets for red wine and white wine.

Normally, the wines are classified into one of the quality ratings specified in the attributes. In this exercise, you will combine the two datasets to predict the wine quality and whether the wine is red or white solely from the attributes.

You will model wine quality estimations as a regression problem and wine type detection as a binary classification problem.
