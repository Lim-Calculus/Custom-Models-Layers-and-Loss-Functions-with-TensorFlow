# Week 4 - Custom Models
You can build off of existing models to add custom functionality. This week, extend the TensorFlow Model Class to build a ResNet model!
## Learning Objectives:
- Explain some benefits to defining a custom model class instead of using the Functional or Sequential APIs
- Define a model by creating a Python class that inherits from TensorFlow's Model class
- Describe functions that can be inherited from the TensorFlow Model class
- Build a residual network by defining a custom model class
